No matter how you stock your kitchen, these simple 7 tips will help you get the best deals and save £100s a year 🥕🍅🛒

**1. Shop on a full stomach.** You’ll buy less snacks and items you’d usually not buy.

**2. Sticking to a list** Plan your meals for the week before you shop then buy what’s on the menu. This way, you’ll think more carefully about what you need and avoid last minute takeaways or trips to more expensive smaller shops to get things you’ve forgotten. People who make a shopping list spend almost £200 a year less on groceries.

**3. Try to shop once a week.** You’ll spend more if you go shopping every day or several times a week. If you need to go into your local shop for a midweek restock, like milk - don’t pick up a basket, just go in and buy the milk.

**4. Think twice about special offers** and only buy what you need. 3-for-2 is only a good deal if you can and will use all three. Also, don’t overlook unbranded items or store brands as many are made by brand name companies, just with a different label.

**5. Get fruit and veg from local market stalls**, which can be 35% cheaper than supermarkets. Buy your staples like rice, spices and sauces from the supermarket ‘world food’ aisle and save up to 75% compared to domestic brands. These are cheaper as these brands aren’t as well known, even though they’re often more authentic.

**6. Reductions!** Using coupons can save you £100s on your shopping. Check out Martin Lewis’ Supermarket Coupons [page](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/deals/supermarket-coupons/) for an up-to-date list of savings. 

Although it’s store-dependent, shoppers say Morrisons and Sainsbury’s begin reductions from lunchtime, with big discounts at Tesco starting from early evening. Asda’s final reductions tend to start from 7pm to 9pm. One saver even managed to spend £2.55 on £60 worth of shopping in Asda’s discounts!
