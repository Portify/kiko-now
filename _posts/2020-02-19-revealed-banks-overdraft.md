In our [last article on overdrafts](https://blog.portify.co/dealing-with-overdraft/), we touched on the general changes being made as a result of the FCA rehaul of the overdraft market. The Chief Executive of the FCA, Andrew Bailey, was appalled that the market was ‘causing significant consumer harm’, and passed new regulations outlawing daily and monthly fees for overdrafts. In 2017 alone, banks made over £2.4billion from overdraft fees with [30% coming from unarranged overdrafts alone](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/saving/article-7922277/Watchdog-fire-new-overdraft-rules-leave-8m-borrowers-worse-off.html).
However, the UK banking industry responded with new overdraft rules. The banks responded with new near identical responses and hikes to their overdraft fees that raised even more concerns for the FCA. We’ve compiled the overdraft changes and the new corresponding interest rates for proposed to go into effect in April for 10 UK banks.

### So what does the overdraft fee changes mean for me?
###### Reduction in cost for small arranged overdrafts: 
Those of us who use an arranged overdraft of £50 over seven days will see their overdraft fee drop from an average of £1.99 to 18p, with five of the ten accounts reviewed now charging less [under the new changes coming into effect](https://moneyfacts.co.uk/news/banking/revealed-the-cost-of-new-bank-account-overdraft-charges/#).
###### Greater penalty for regular use of larger arranged overdraft: 
Unfortunately, for those of us that tend to dip into a larger arranged overdraft, the average fee for an arranged overdraft of £500 over 30 days increases - from an average base of £8.96 to £10.29.
###### Savings for accidental overdrawn accounts: 
The average fee for an unarranged overdraft of £50 over seven days across the banks reviewed is £26.87. However, under the new changes in place, this reduces to an average of 20p. Those who may dip into a slightly larger unarranged overdraft also experience a reduction - dipping £500 across 30 days [reduces from an average of £54.91 to £8.06](https://moneyfacts.co.uk/news/banking/revealed-the-cost-of-new-bank-account-overdraft-charges/).
