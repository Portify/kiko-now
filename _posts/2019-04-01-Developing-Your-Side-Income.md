Do you want to make some extra money in your spare time? Online platforms make it easy to find freelance gigs to earn some extra income. We've put together a few options here ðŸ’°

**Becoming a driver.** Working for platforms like Deliveroo, Stuart, UberEats and Hermes may  help you boost your income while staying flexible. Generally, working during lunchtime and evenings rather than mornings, as well as on weekends (7pm to 9pm) may give you a higher chance of earning more due to a higher volume of orders.

**Doing handy work.** Using platforms like TaskRabbit allows you to get paid for odd jobs and even assembling flat pack furniture! 

**Investing in an item.** Some of our users have also managed to boost their income by investing in an item through a one-off payment and renting it out for a higher return on their money. For example, weâ€™ve seen bicycles for rent on Fat Llama for between Â£7 to Â£45 per day.
