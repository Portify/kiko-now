You may have heard of a few new names recently in the world of finance and banking, which aim to help manage your finances better through using â€˜Open Bankingâ€™ ðŸ¤”

But what exactly is Open Banking, and how can it help you as a flexible worker?

### What does Open Banking mean?

According to a recent survey conducted by [Which?](https://www.which.co.uk/news/2017/10/open-banking-92-of-the-public-in-the-dark/), a staggering 92% of the general public didnâ€™t know what Open Banking was. 

Donâ€™t worry, the team at Portify is here to help! 

Open Banking is a set of regulations, adopted in January 2018, which allows third party providers to access your basic banking data.

Third parties were already accessing your data before January 2018, but via 'screen-scraping' your information. They did this by obtaining your passwords and logging-on to your online banking in a â€˜read-onlyâ€™ format.

Open Banking is the secure and regulated way to give authorised providers access to your financial information.

These authorised third parties will be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or another European regulator, and will appear on the FCA's Register.

### What is Open Banking used for?

Itâ€™s a super useful piece of tech because it allows financial empowerment platforms - like Portify - to work even quicker when providing you with the products, or tools that you need to achieve financial wellbeing.

The idea behind these changes is that they'll bring more competition and innovation to financial services which, in turn, is hoped will lead to more and better products to help manage your money. 

It will also give you a more detailed understanding of your accounts, and help you find new ways to make the most of your money.

### How can Open Banking benefit me?

Letâ€™s say, for example, you buy a coffee on your way to work everyday. You may think â€˜but itâ€™s only Â£2.50â€™, and barely notice it on your weekly bank statements. 

Open Banking allows you to see how much that is on a monthly basis, and suddenly by making small changes youâ€™re making huge savings. 

If you bought a coffee each work day for a year, it would add up to over Â£600!! Think of the things you could do with that moneyâ€¦ suddenly that saving doesnâ€™t seem so small!

### What if you donâ€™t want to make use of Open Banking?

You donâ€™t have to share your data if you donâ€™t want to! Open Banking is a strictly â€˜opt-inâ€™ service and will only change the way your data is shared if you give express permission for the change.

---

### What data do Open Banking apps use?

Open Banking apps only have access to your banking data, such as transactions and direct debits (basically, whatever appears on your statements). 

The regulations also state that Open Banking apps have to use APIs to access your data (see the section on APIs below), and this is the most secure way of sharing your data and ensures that only the data you give permission for can be shared.

---

### What are APIs?

API stands for application programming interface and is essentially the way in which different systems communicate with one another and share information.

They are what is used by platforms such as Deliveroo or Uber when it accesses your location through Google Maps.

They mean that one company can access specific data that another company has, without you sharing your passwords with anyone. 

Before anything like this can happen you will be asked for your permission and you should always check exactly what you are giving permission for.
