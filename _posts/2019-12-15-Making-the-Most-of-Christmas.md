**Keeping your purse happy and healthy during the holiday season**

The Holidays are fast approaching, and we at Portify are sure that many of you can’t wait to take some time to rest, recharge, spend some time with your loved ones - and dig in to some quality food! 

Now the December holidays is a notorious time for spending. Presents, sales, reductions and more are the name of the game. However, at Portify, we want to make sure our community are ahead of the crowd when it comes to your Christmas bargains. Here are some of our top tips when it comes to saving as much money as possible during the Christmas season. 

### 1) Be Honest About What You Can Afford

Many of us have grand plans for what we want to holiday season to look like, feel like and taste like. It’s great to have a big old vision for the time, but sometimes our vision outstrips our capacity to afford it. Sometimes, we need to sit down with ourselves and be frank about what we can afford without putting our finances at risk.

A great way to make sure you’ve got a handle on what is coming into your account is checking insights on the Portify app - we’ve got cashflow tools to help you manage exactly what comes in and when.

Write down what your current income is, and write up a list of all the things you want to purchase. If your second list total expenditure is higher than your income, it’s worth thinking more critically about what you can afford, realistically, to spend. 

### 2) Prioritise Your Expenditure 

Very much related to the prior point, it’s important to prioritise what needs to be taken care of in light of your current income and responsibilities. 

Ensure you have taken care of necessities, such as bills, non-negotiable direct-debits and groceries before you spend on other holiday-related items. That way, you’ll reduce any stress that may come as a result of unpaid bills and unaccounted expenses. 

### 3) Sell Your Old Belongings Ahead of Christmas Season

Secure some extra cash and make sure you sell your old belongings ahead of Christmas. Sometimes we have items floating around that we don’t really use, but may sell for a price which may increase your overall Christmas income. Take a look at what you haven’t used in a while and could do without, and sell on popular online market sites. It’s a great way to replenish your account after holiday spending too!

### 4) Buy Your Groceries At the Cheapest Supermarkets

Make sure you leverage your opportunity to save on necessities like groceries. Aldi, Lidl and Asda have consistently ranked as some of UK’s [cheapest supermarkets]. (https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/uks-cheapest-supermarket-officially-revealed-16549881). 
Purchasing your items at cheaper supermarkets will decrease the cost of total grocery expenditure, which is super useful at a time like Christmas when you may be cooking for either more people - or just cooking more food in general!

### 5) Start Saving and Buying Early to Afford Christmas Gifts

It may go without saying but don’t wait until the last minute to purchase Christmas gifts! It’s not necessary to buy presents all at once, or wait until the day before Christmas to purchase presents. 

You can either begin to buy gifts well in advance, or spread gift purchase over the last few weeks of Christmas to give yourself time to scour sites like eBay and Amazon for cheaper deals.
