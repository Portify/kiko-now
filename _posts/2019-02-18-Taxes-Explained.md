## **Income tax rates for 2019 to 2020:**

* Earnings below Â£12,500 are tax free. This is called your personal allowance

* Basic income tax rate is 20% for earnings between Â£12,501 to Â£50,000

* This increases to 40% for earnings between Â£50,001 to Â£150,000

* This increases to 45% for earnings over Â£150,000

### For example, if you work flexible hours and your total income after deducting expenses is Â£20,000 a year:

* Â£12,500 is tax-free

* Â£7,500 taxable income at the basic rate

* At the basic rate of 20%, youâ€™d be taxed Â£1,500

### What you need to fill in a self-assessment tax return:

* Your 10 digit Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR). Youâ€™ll get this when you register as self-employed. It is made up of 10 digits and given to you by HMRC

* Your National Insurance number

* Details of your untaxed income from the tax year. This can be from self-employment, dividends and interest from shares

    Note: A basic rate taxpayer has a Personal Savings Allowance (PSA) of Â£1,000. So, the first Â£1,000 of savings interest earned in a year is tax-free. You would only have to pay tax on savings interest above this

* Records of any expenses relating to self-employment

* Any contributions to charity or pensions where deductions were made after tax

* A P60: At the end of each financial year (April), you will receive this summary document from your employer, which shows how much Income Tax and National Insurance you and your employer have paid throughout the year

* A P45 if you have left a job in the current tax year

## Other tips:
**1. Have a system**

Itâ€™s important to develop a way to regularly track your income and expenses - on paper, software or by hiring an accountant. 

You can use the Portify app to help you with this as it automatically tracks these with a bank connection. 

If you need a little more support, you can always hire an accountant to help you out, and Portify even have a partnership with **TaxScouts** to offer you a 10% discount on their services. You can find more information find out about TaxScouts [here](https://taxscouts.com/).

**2. Set aside some money**

As someone working flexible hours, you may not have an employer deducting taxes from your income each time youâ€™re paid. 

To help with this, Portify provides you with a tax estimate. Have a look at this estimate from time to time to make sure you have enough money set aside to make that annual payment less demanding.
